<h2><strong><u>Background to the beginning and causes of World War II</strong></h2></u></h1>

<p>World War II was one of the most appalling events in the History of manking. Millions of people lost their lives needlessly and millions more suffered terrible trauma and appalling psychological distress.
World War II had it's evil roots stemming from the outcome of World War I and how the circumstances that lead to the ending of the first World War had greatly impacted on the minds of the German people. Germany had to pay over Â£6 billion pounds in reparations for the damages caused due to the first World War. On top of that, the Treaty of Versaille was not welcomed by the German people and the German government.</p> 

<p>German society felt a sense of humiliation and blame since the ending of the 1st World War and this humiliation began to grow more and more into a sense of degradation, blame and an unequal level of blame being forced upon the German people. Thus, this feeling of blame and humiliation began to grow into a need for "revenge" in German society.</p>

<p>Adolf Hitler fought in the 1st World War and received an Iron Cross for bravery. With his past experience of War and his belief that Germany needed to be removed from all blame for the 1st World War, this lead him down the path of Political ideology.</p>

<p>Hitler bacame Chancellor of Germany in the 1930's and with the death of German President Hindenberg, Hitler then became President of Germany - The Highest position in government, which was colloqually referred to as "The Fuhrer".

Hitler was now in Pole position to lead his political party - The Reichstag - down the road of retribution for the sense of humiliation and defeat that had stemmed in German society's minds like a cancer, from the 1st World War.</p>

<p>Thus, in essence, this sense of humiliation and blame provided ample motivation for Hitler's quest to seek revenge on his neighbouring countries. Thus in September 1939 the second World War began in ernest when Hitler ordered the invasion of Poland.</p>
